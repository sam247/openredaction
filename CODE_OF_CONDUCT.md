We want OpenRedaction to be a welcoming, inclusive, and collaborative community. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants and the process for reporting unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or similar characteristics.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Showing empathy and kindness to other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without consent

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They may remove or edit comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code.

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces—GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, the wiki, documentation, and any other channel defined by the project—as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers through GitHub. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
